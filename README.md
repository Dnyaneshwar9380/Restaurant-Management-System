# Restaurant-Management-System
This project is a simple Restaurant Ordering System in Python. It displays a menu with prices, takes user input for items, checks availability, and calculates the total bill. The program allows adding multiple items and gives feedback on ordered items, providing a basic simulation of a restaurant billing process.
